## About Repo <a name = "about"></a>

This repository will document my learning journey of the React framework. These projects will originate from tutorials and guides I have followed online. 
The end goal is to have a React project that houses multiple tutorials in one spot. Once I have a better understanding of the framework I will create a seperate project using the concepts learned in this repository!

The following items are the sources I used that enabled me to learn new concepts.
